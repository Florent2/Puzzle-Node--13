Chess Move Evaluator
===

This is my solution to the [Puzzle Node exercise 13](http://puzzlenode.com/puzzles/22).

It has been tested only with Ruby 1.9.

You can get the list of move evaluations from a board input file and a move input file with the following command:

    $ ./chess_move_evaluator.rb complex_board.txt complex_moves.txt

To get the result in a file:

    $ ./chess_move_evaluator.rb complex_board.txt complex_moves.txt > complex_results.txt
